## Effortlessly navigate through BitindiWallet using keyboard shortcuts and execute actions on specific screens with simple key combinations to enhance your BlockWallet experience.

### How do keyboard shortcuts work?

Keyboard shortcuts are switched on by default.

You can turn them off and back on in Settings - Preferences - Keyboard Shortcuts.

When turned on, you can use a combination of keys to speed up the process when using your BlockWallet account (see full list below).

## Quickly turn Keyboard Shortcuts ON/OFF

ALT+K on Windows or OPT+K on Mac are the only combinations you need to know.

If Keyboard shortcuts are OFF and you press this combination, you will get easy access to the setting so you can turn it back ON.

If Keyboard Shortcuts are ON and you press this combination, you will see all the relevant shortcuts for the current screen.

## Opening the BlockWallet Extension

If you want to open your BitindiWallet extension, you can use the combination ALT/OPT+O whenever you are browsing, and BitindiWallet will pop up.

## Open or close the BitindiWallet extension

WINDOWS =	ALT+O
MAC = OPT+O

## Global keyboard shortcuts

As previously mentioned, ALT/OPT+K functions on any screen, even when shortcuts are disabled. When shortcuts are enabled, three additional key combinations will also work on any screen.

These are the 4 global keyboard shortcuts that you should know about.

### WINDOWS 
Show keyboard shortcuts for current screen = ALT+K
Lock wallet = CTRL+ALT+L
Go back to previous screen = ALT+BACKSPACE
Back to Home = ALT+Q

### MAC

Show keyboard shortcuts for current screen = OPT+K
Lock wallet = CTRL+OPT+L
