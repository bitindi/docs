## Introduction
The validators are a unique part of the Bitindi ecosystem. They are responsible for producing the blocks in the blockchain. Anyone can become a validator by fulfilling its requirements. The validators earn percentage of the transaction fee paid by the users. Learn more about this in [consensus](/docs/governance/consensus/) section.

Validators's core responsibility is reliable block production. However in practice becoming a validator is a highly competitive game, and as a result Validators may also provide additional services to the community, such as:
 - host Bitindi chain boot nodes
 - host fast sync block export/import infrastructure
 - develop and maintain DevOps tooling
 - develop and maintain security tooling
 - develop and maintain block explorers, RPC nodes, SQL indexers and other
   public good infrastructure

## Become a validator
This guide only covers setting up the validator node, however there is a lot more to being a validator than running a node.

### Start the validator node

 1.) Setup environment and install Bitindi. [Please follow this section](/docs/developers/install/)

 2.) Deploy the validator node. [Please follow this section](/docs/developers/deploy/)

Once you successfully complete above steps, you are now a validator, and you are now securiting the network and earning staking reward at the same time.
