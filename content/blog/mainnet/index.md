The Bitindi mainnet is launching. Bitindi chain is not just an Ethereum clone - is built from ground up with new blockchain technology, and as such carries risk of potentially disruptive bugs.

For this reason we are opting in for a slow release. The mainnet is available for developers to deploy their Solidity smart contracts and develop DeFi applications using Bitindi chain.

Our goal for the next quarter is to improve developer tooling and [encourage](https://bitindi.medium.com/bitindi-blockhain-mainnet-live-event-soon-759992a616e9/) ecosystem development.
Once the chain is deemed stable we will be enabling the liquidity bridge between BSC and Bitindi chain,
as well as increase the BPoS validator slots.


## Developer support
We are inviting developers to join us in [Bitindi chat](https://t.me/bitindi) with any questions related to Bitindi chain. The developer chat can also be used to interact with the automated Bitindi chain testnet faucet.
